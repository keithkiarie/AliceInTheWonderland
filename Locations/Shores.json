        "It's a bit weird thinking you're in the shores of the sea of your own tears.\nYou and all the animals in the shore are all soaking wet. Dodo organizes a Caucus race in which everybody wins to dry you up. After the race, Dodo and the animals demand that you give an item that they will present as a prize for winning the race. You should probably give Dodo something.",

        "You are back at the Shores outside the Long Hall. It is nice and dry.",
