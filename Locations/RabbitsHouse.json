        "You've reached the white rabbit's house. It is a tiny house.\nOutside, you meet an old snail who engages you in a long conversation.\nYou tell her how you got here and how you feel like you don't really have control over what is happening to you.\nShe offers you a mushroom that you can eat in pieces and change your size anytime.\nMay be you would like to collect the mushroom.",

        "You meet the White Rabbit and he informs you that Queen's guard arrested Dinah when Dinah chased him upto the Queen's residence.\nHe won't let Dinah free though, unless you do him a quick favor.\nFind a hand fan and glove that he is supposed to take to the Queen but he seems to have misplaced.\nYou don't seem to have much choice, do you? Let's go find those items.",

        "You are at the White Rabbit's house. If you have found his items, you can give them to him.",

        "The rabbit appreciates your help but says that it is already too late Dinah might be up for execution.\nHe says that if you go to the March Hare's house and back, time will be taken back and he'll be able to get Dinah.\nLet's go find the March Hare's house",

        "Success! The white rabbit helps you get Dinah and shows you your way back.",
